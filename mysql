1. round(N, D):
* N: A number which will be rounded upto D decimal places.

2. CASE WHEN ... THEN...    WHEN ... THEN .... ELSE... END
SELECT CASE WHEN A+B>C AND B+C>A AND A+C>B
THEN
    CASE WHEN A=B AND B=C THEN 'Equilateral'
        WHEN A=B OR B=C OR C=A THEN 'Isosceles'
        WHEN A!=B AND B!=C AND C!=A THEN 'Scalene' END
    ELSE 'Not A Triangle' END
FROM TRIANGLES;

3. Get the average of a variable:
AVG(cloumn_name)

4. 
SELECT CONCAT('There are a total of ', COUNT(*), ' ', LOWER(OCCUPATION), 's.')
FROM OCCUPATIONS
GROUP BY OCCUPATION
ORDER BY COUNT(NAME) ASC, OCCUPATION ASC;

5. 
SELECT CONCAT(NAME, '(',SUBSTR(OCCUPATION, 1, 1), ')')
FROM OCCUPATIONS
ORDER BY NAME ASC;

6.
SET @R1 = 0, @R2 = 0, @R3 = 0, @R4 = 0;
SELECT MAX(Doctor), MAX(Professor), MAX(Singer), MAX(Actor)
FROM
(SELECT CASE WHEN OCCUPATION = 'Doctor' THEN (@R1:=@R1+1)
WHEN OCCUPATION = 'Professor' THEN (@R2:=@R2+1)
WHEN OCCUPATION = 'Singer' THEN (@R3:=@R3+1)
WHEN OCCUPATION = 'Actor' THEN (@R4:=@R4+1) END AS RowNumber,
CASE WHEN OCCUPATION = 'Doctor' THEN NAME END AS Doctor,
CASE WHEN OCCUPATION = 'Professor' THEN NAME END AS Professor,
CASE WHEN OCCUPATION = 'Singer' THEN NAME END AS Singer,
CASE WHEN OCCUPATION = 'Actor' THEN NAME END AS Actor
FROM OCCUPATIONS
ORDER BY NAME ASC) Temp
GROUP BY RowNumber;

(1) set @r2 = 0    ==> User defined variable;
(2) The code aggregate rows together using GROUP BY RowNumber and MAX(or Min) statement:
MIN()/MAX() will return a name for specific index and specific occupation. If there is a name, they wiil return it. 
If there is not, they will return a NULL.

7. You can combine CASE logistic and subquery together!
SELECT N, CASE WHEN P IS NULL THEN 'Root' 
WHEN N IN (SELECT P FROM BST) THEN 'Inner' 
ELSE 'Leaf' END
FROM BST
ORDER BY N ASC;

8. query rows based on the information from two tables:
SELECT CITY.NAME
FROM CITY, COUNTRY
WHERE CITY.CountryCode = COUNTRY.Code AND CONTINENT = 'Africa';

SELECT CITY.NAME
FROM CITY INNER JOIN COUNTRY ON CountryCode = Code
WHERE CONTINENT = 'Africa';
